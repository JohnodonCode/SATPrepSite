This model generally offers listeners the choice to pay more or less than a suggested price for a song or album—or even to pay nothing at all. As the authors note, that’s the option most listeners chose for an album by the band Harvey Danger. Only about 1% opted to pay for the album, resulting in earnings below the band’s expectations. But the authors also discuss musician Jane Siberry, who saw significant earnings from her “pay as you wish” online music store as a result of many listeners choosing to pay more than the store’s suggested prices. Hence, the “pay as you wish” model may ______",

          "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. In one example, musicians made less money than expected by using the “pay as you wish” model. In the other example, a musician made more money than expected. This suggests that some musicians may have more success than others using the “pay as you wish” model.<br /><br />Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. In the examples provided, the individual musician was more successful with the “pay as you wish” model than the band was. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The passage provides no instances in which musicians changed the suggested prices of their songs or albums, nor does it mention this as a possibility. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses the differences in popularity of different musicians, so there is no basis to make this inference."

A student writing a history paper, however, hypothesizes that Gidra’s influence cannot be measured by the number of newsletters published monthly alone.",

Choice A is incorrect. \"Borrow\" means \"to take something with intent to return it.\" The text doesn’t say anything about taking and returning the wilderness that surrounds the Appalachian Trail. Choice B is incorrect. \"Postpone\" means \"to put off until later.\" Nothing in the passage suggests that Congress wants to \"postpone\" the wilderness areas (and that doesn’t make sense anyway—they can postpone doing something to the wilderness areas, but they can’t postpone the areas themselves). Choice D is incorrect. \"Decorate\" means \"to adorn\" or \"add extra items or pictures to make more attractive.\" No details in thetext suggest that Congress wishes to make the trail fancier or more attractive."

The text describes Polly as being frightened of Fanny’s friends because they seemed “much older and wiser” to her and elaborates that they “talked about things of which” Polly was unfamiliar, uninterested, and shocked. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe Polly’s impressions of Fanny’s other friends. <br/><br/> Choice B is incorrect because the text does not provide any of the topics Polly discussed with Fanny’s friends, stating only that Polly found the topics unfamiliar, uninteresting, and shocking. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Fanny and her other friends first met. Choice D is incorrect because the focus of the text is on Polly’s feelings about Fanny’s other friends, not on the other friends’ feelings about Polly."

It is best, however, to understand Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards.<br /><br /> <strong> Text 2 </strong><br/><br/>It is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka’s plays to fit neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka’s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount significant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time. ",

The author of Text 1 states that Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, implying that this is a helpful way to understand his works. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, challenges this view and says that it overlooks potential commonalities and differences in Soyinka’s work across what Text 1 calls distinctive stylistic phases. Choice B is incorrect. This choice overstates the central claim of Text 2. The author of Text 2 argues against the chronological progression supported in Text 1, but does not go so far as to say that Soyinka’s style remained consistent. In fact, Text 2 points out “significant differences in styles and content” among Soyinka’s plays. Choice C is incorrect. Neither of the texts mention Soyinka’s poetry, nor do they rank his dramatic writing relative to his other work. Choice D is incorrect. Assessment SAT Neither text discusses the political aspects of Soyinka’s plays, nor do they make any claims about whether they have changed over time."

    "rationale": "Choice C is correct. Let x represent the number of 2-person tents and let y represent the number of 4-person tents. It is given that the total number of tents was 60 and the total number of people in the group was 202. This situation can be expressed as a system of two equations, x + y =60 and 2x + 4y = 202. The first equation can be rewritten as y = -x + 60. Substituting -x + 60 for y in the equation 2x + 4y = 202 yields 2x + 4(-x + 60)=202. Distributing and combining like terms gives -2x + 240 = 202. Subtracting 240 from both sides of -2x + 240 = 202 and then dividing both sides by -2 gives x = 19. Therefore, the number of 2-person tents is 19. <br /><br />Alternate approach: If each of the 60 tents held 4 people, the total number of people that could be accommodated in tents would be 240. However, the actual number of people who slept in tents was 202. The difference of 38 accounts for the 2-person tents. Since each of these tents holds 2 people fewer than a 4-person tent,38/2 = 19 gives the number of 2-person tents. Choice A is incorrect. This choice may result from assuming exactly half of the tents hold 2 people. If that were true, then the total number of people who slept in tents would be 2(30) + 4(30) = 180;however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 180. Choice B is incorrect. If 20 tents were 2-person tents, then the remaining 40 tents would be 4-person tents. Since all the tents were filled to capacity, the total number of people who slept in tents would be 2(20) + 4(40) = 40 + 160 = 200;however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 200. Choice D is incorrect. If 18 tents were 2-person tents, then the remaining 42 tents would be 4-person tents. Since all the tents were filled to capacity, the total number of people who slept in tents would be 2(18) + 4(42) = 36 + 168 = 204; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 204."
