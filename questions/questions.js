This model generally offers listeners the choice to pay more or less than a suggested price for a song or album—or even to pay nothing at all. As the authors note, that’s the option most listeners chose for an album by the band Harvey Danger. Only about 1% opted to pay for the album, resulting in earnings below the band’s expectations. But the authors also discuss musician Jane Siberry, who saw significant earnings from her “pay as you wish” online music store as a result of many listeners choosing to pay more than the store’s suggested prices.

In the other example, a musician made more money than expected.

In the examples provided, the individual musician was more successful with the “pay as you wish” model than the band was. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The passage provides no instances in which musicians changed the suggested prices of their songs or albums, nor does it mention this as a possibility. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses the differences in popularity of different musicians, so there is no basis to make this inference."

The newsletter had an expansive reach for a publication of its kind: around 4,000 copies were published each month. A student writing a history paper, however, hypothesizes that Gidra’s influence cannot be measured by the number of newsletters published monthly alone.",

If there were more Gidra readers than there were copies of the newsletter, then the newsletter’s influence would be much greater than its 4,000 monthly copies. Choice A is incorrect. Information about the newsletter’s initial funding doesn’t tell us about the influence that the newsletter eventually had. Choice B is incorrect. While the content of Gidra was undoubtedly related to the newsletter’s influence, this information isn’t relevant to the specific hypothesis about monthly circulation numbers. Choice C is incorrect. Where the publishers of Gidra were initially based doesn’t tell us about the newsletter’s overall influence."

This choice makes the noun phrase 'Anna Behrensmeyer' the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase 'a pioneer...fossils.' In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that Anna Behrensmeyer—and not another noun in the sentence—is a pioneer in the field of taphonomy.<br /><br />Choice A is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase 'fossils of thin-shelled organisms' immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the 'fossils' are a pioneer in the field of taphonomy. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the pronoun 'it' immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that 'it' is a pioneer in the field of taphonomy.

No punctuation is needed to set off the proper noun 'Wakako Yamauchi' from the title that describes Yamauchi, 'pioneering playwright.' Because 'Wakako Yamauchi' is essential information identifying the 'pioneering playwright,' no punctuation is necessary.<br /><br />Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed before or after the proper noun 'Wakako Yamauchi.' Setting the playwright’s name off with commas suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn’t the case.

It's also given that the equation <strong>5.48x + 7.30y = 1,277.94</strong> represents this situation, where <strong>x</strong> is the number of smaller containers sold and <strong>y</strong> is the number of larger containers sold. Since <strong>x</strong> represents the number of smaller containers of yogurt sold, the expression <strong>5.48x</strong> represents the total sales, in dollars, from smaller containers of yogurt. This means that <strong>x</strong> smaller containers of yogurt were sold at a price of <strong>5.48</strong> dollars each.
